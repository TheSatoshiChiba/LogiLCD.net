LogiLCD.net
===========

This library is no longer in development! I will however accept pull requests for fixes/changes.

Release Notes
-------------

LogiLCD.net is a .NET wrapper for the Logitech Gaming LCD SDK V1.01. It is written in C# with .NET 4.5 and supports the x86 and x64 version of the native library. It behaves exactly the same as the native SDK except that the defines have been packed in simple enumerations and all methods have been packed into one class named LogiLcd. Just reference the LogiLcd Assembly and you are good to go. The main namespace to use is dd.logilcd. For an example to see how to use the Library simply take a look into the sample Application.

Supported Devices
-----------------
G19 ( TESTED )
G510 ( UNTESTED )
G13 ( UNTESTED )
G15 v1 ( UNTESTED )
G15 v2 ( UNTESTED )

If you have tested the wrapper with one of the untested devices please send me your results.

Clarification
-------------
I am in no way affiliated with Logitech. I am just an enthusiastic developer that likes the Logitech Gaming Lcd SDK and I wanted to make it usable under C#.
